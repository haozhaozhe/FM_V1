Code
The code for generating each figure has been uploaded.

The majority of the analyses and data preprocessing followed the standard analysis pipline.

Addition analysis have been provided in the scctools.py file.

The codes will also be updated based on the correspondences received.

DATA
Expression matrix and the metadata are publicly available in arrayExpress with the accession number:

E-MTAB-10459 (Macaque V1 10X genomics dataset)

E-MTAB- (Macaque V1 10X genomics dataset).

The raw sequencing files (fastq) are public available with the same accession numbers.
